        <h1> Below The Rage </h1>
    </div>
    <div id="poem">
<p>
I see you hear that distant roar?<br>
I know you hear the ocean’s rage.<br>
But, continue past the mad rampage,<br>
Beyond and down below, find the ocean’s floor.<br>
</p>
<p>
Back above, the waves whip and churn.<br>
Yet below, they hold you and embrace.<br>
Gently, silently, bringing in new space.<br>
Does your heart begin to yearn?<br>
</p>
<p>
There is life upon this seabed.<br>
Flurries of yellow and gray sway through,<br>
And cities of coral spread vast in the deep blue. <br>
Do you start to prefer these depths instead?<br>
</p>
<p>
But, when you surface and return to home,<br>
The sky is pouring and the sun is gone.<br>
It feels hostile, just as if there were no dawn.<br>
This wasteland will be a mad life to roam.<br>
</p>
<p>
So retreat! Dive underneath the world’s edge!<br>
Recall the tranquil depths as you descend!<br>
The peaceful fishes will be your new friend.<br>
And you’ll never return, this you’ll pledge. <br>
</p>
<p >
So when you hear the distant roar,<br>
When you feel the ocean’s rage.<br>
Find a way to move past that page,<br>
And look towards the ocean’s door.<br>
</p>
